# React DOM Class and Function Components

The [React Dev official documentation docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#migrating-a-simple-component-from-a-class-to-a-function) gives instructions on how to migrate a React class component to a function. 
This project shows a React class component and a React function component which are feature-equivalent. If you're a React developer looking to convert your classes to take advantage of React hooks, I hope this project gives you a starting point!

```
npm install
npm run build-styles
